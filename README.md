Tried to build a website where users could choose what game to play, and we created four games in Python: ConnectN, TicTacToe, Hunger Games, and Battleship.
We built a Python Flask API, but didn't have time to create the link between the games and the website
Used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, to create the website
jQuery was used to link the pages
